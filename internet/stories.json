      "story": "Minor royal Princess Georgina has fallen victim to yet another media sting operation on her latest visit to the USA. The party-loving young royal, believing wholeheartedly that she was on a tour of impoverished inner city Los Santos neighborhoods, was lured into a trap by unscrupulous paparazzi to make it look like she was buying marijuana from a drug dealer. Princess Georgina is said to be devastated and embarrassed that she allowed herself to be taken advantage of so naively. Maybe if the Americans had their own royal family instead of worshiping pathetic celebrities, they might show some semblance of class, morality and common decency."

      "story": "The suburbs and outskirts of Los Santos are undergoing what some say is an apocalyptic plague. Residents say invasive species harass residents of gated communities who moved to the wilderness in order to live a stress free life away from deer. They claim that wildlife eat their gardens. Local governments are discussing a massive poisoning initiative in order to reset the balance. Maybe they should try the residents first."

        "story": "If you don't own a gun, go out and buy one. If you already own some guns, go out and buy some more. If your criminal record, age, or bill of mental health prevents you from purchasing a gun at a gun store, go to a fair or become an antique gun collector. Three criminals went into the Blaine County Savings Bank in Paleto Bay earlier today, and came out covered from head to toe in body armor with the contents of several safety deposit boxes in bags on their backs. Paleto Bay has some of the highest gun ownership per capita in the country, but there's no one wishing that number wasn't even higher today."

        "writer": "Patricia Lynn - Talkin' Balls",
        "story": "Soccer remains ignored and unloved in this country mainly due to long and tedious uninterrupted action, which doesn't sit well with the American palate. The LS Benders have recently announced a deal with CNT to broadcast the games. Rules will be changed to allow commercial breaks every after every 1 - 2 minutes of play. This is an exciting move for a game not enjoyed by the American public who can't get enough of funny commercials."
