      "story": "Minor royal Princess Georgina has fallen victim to yet another media sting operation on her latest visit to the USA. The party-loving young royal, believing wholeheartedly that she was on a tour of impoverished inner city Los Santos neighborhoods, was lured into a trap by unscrupulous paparazzi to make it look like she was buying marijuana from a drug dealer. Princess Georgina is said to be devastated and embarrassed that she allowed herself to be taken advantage of so naively. Maybe if the Americans had their own royal family instead of worshiping pathetic celebrities, they might show some semblance of class, morality and common decency."

      "story": "The suburbs and outskirts of Los Santos are undergoing what some say is an apocalyptic plague. Residents say invasive species harass residents of gated communities who moved to the wilderness in order to live a stress free life away from deer. They claim that wildlife eat their gardens. Local governments are discussing a massive poisoning initiative in order to reset the balance. Maybe they should try the residents first."
